Karabiner mapping shortcuts for Sun Keyboards

If you are using a fantastical Sun Keyboard (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sun_Oracle_type-7_keyboard.jpg)and want to map some of their extra key to you Mac, you can use this script in your Karabiner (https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) installation.

We current support the following extra keyboard mapping:

Again - Mapped as CMD+Y
Undo  - Mapped as CMD+Z
Copy  - Mapped as CMD+C
Paste - CMD+SHIFT+V that will paste without formating \0/ 
Cut   - CMD+X

Have fun!
